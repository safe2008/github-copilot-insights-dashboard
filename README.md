## Why Copilot Insights?

GitHub Copilot is transforming how teams write code — but without visibility into how it's being used, it's hard to measure the return on your investment. Copilot Insights bridges that gap by providing:

- **Adoption tracking** — see which teams and users are actively using Copilot, and where adoption lags
- **License optimization** — identify unused seats and potential savings across your enterprise
- **Model intelligence** — understand which AI models drive the most value and how AI credit budgets are consumed
- **Productivity metrics** — measure code completions, agent usage, PR impact, and CLI adoption in one place
- **Enterprise governance** — role-based access, audit logging, and team-level filtering for compliance

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16.2 App Router, React 19.2, Tailwind CSS 4.2, Chart.js 4.5
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes, Drizzle ORM 0.45, Zod 4.3
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 18 (star schema — 10 dimensions + 9 fact tables)
- **ETL**: Custom ingest pipeline with GitHub Copilot Usage Metrics API (v2026-03-10)
- **Billing data**: Seats fetched live; AI Credits fetched from GitHub billing API and snapshotted for trend continuity
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Container Apps, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Container Registry, Key Vault

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 24+ and **pnpm** (`corepack enable`)
- **PostgreSQL** 18+ (local or cloud)
- **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** with Copilot enabled
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** with `manage_billing:copilot`, `read:enterprise`, `read:org` scopes

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ghcp-dashboard.git
cd ghcp-dashboard

# 2. Install dependencies
cd app
pnpm install

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database URL and admin password

# 4. Run database migrations
pnpm exec drizzle-kit migrate

# 5. Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and navigate to **Settings** to configure your GitHub token and sync schedule.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string (e.g. `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db`) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | No | Password for Settings page access. If unset, settings are open to all. Only leave this unset for local development on a trusted machine |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | No | Password gate for all dashboard pages. If unset, dashboards are open to all. Only leave this unset for local development or intentionally public dashboards |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID` | No | Git commit SHA shown in sidebar footer (auto-set in Docker) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TIME` | No | Build timestamp shown in sidebar footer (auto-set in Docker) |

> [!WARNING]
> For any non-local deployment, set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to protect the **Settings** page. The Settings UI can configure the GitHub token, Enterprise slug, and sync interval. If dashboard pages should not be publicly accessible, also set `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`. Leaving these unset is only recommended for local development on a trusted machine.
The **GitHub token**, **Enterprise slug**, and **sync interval** are configured via the Settings UI and stored in the database.

## Scripts

```bash
pnpm run dev          # Start dev server
pnpm run build        # Production build
pnpm run start        # Start production server
pnpm run lint         # ESLint check
pnpm run db:generate  # Generate Drizzle migrations
pnpm run db:migrate   # Run migrations
pnpm run db:push      # Push schema to DB
pnpm run ingest       # Manual data ingest
```

## Data Sync

The dashboard supports two sync modes:

1. **Auto-sync**: Background sync on a configurable interval (default: every 6 hours). Runs via `instrumentation.ts` on server startup.
2. **Manual sync**: Trigger from the Settings → Data Sync page via SSE streaming.

Both modes call the GitHub Copilot Usage Metrics API (v2026-03-10) and transform the data into a star schema for analytics queries.
