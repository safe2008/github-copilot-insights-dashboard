## ✨ New in v1.0 — AI Analyst

Copilot Insights now includes an optional **AI Analyst** powered by the GitHub Copilot SDK. It turns your synced Copilot data into structured Markdown briefings for engineering leaders, covering **cost and license optimization**, **adoption coaching**, **executive summaries**, **delivery impact**, **ROI and spend forecasts**, and **team scorecards**.

The AI Analyst is designed for transparency and governance:

- 🧠 **Grounded analysis** — every narrative is generated from dashboard metrics, enterprise context, org topology, feature mix, and persisted access/seat signals
- 📊 **Business-ready output** — structured Markdown with key metrics, risks, recommended actions, caveats, and analysis confidence
- 🏢 **Enterprise personalization** — admins can provide additional instructions and assumptions, such as hourly cost, priority teams, and reporting preferences
- 🔒 **Operational control** — AI is off by default, uses a dedicated Copilot token, caches generated insights, and includes a cache management panel
- 🔍 **Transparency report** — see [docs/ai-analyst.md](docs/ai-analyst.md) for what data is sent, prompt structure, cache behavior, and security model

## 💡 Why Copilot Insights?

GitHub Copilot is transforming how teams write code — but without visibility into how it's being used, it's hard to measure the return on your investment. Copilot Insights bridges that gap by providing:

- 📈 **Adoption tracking** — see which teams and users are actively using Copilot, and where adoption lags
- 💰 **License optimization** — identify unused seats and potential savings across your enterprise
- 🤖 **Model intelligence** — understand which AI models drive the most value and how AI credit budgets are consumed
- 🧠 **AI-powered analyst briefings** — convert raw metrics into executive, cost, adoption, delivery, ROI, and team recommendations
- ⚡ **Productivity metrics** — measure code completions, agent usage, PR impact, and CLI adoption in one place
- 🔒 **Enterprise governance** — role-based access, audit logging, and team-level filtering for compliance

- **Billing data**: Seats fetched live; AI Credits fetched from GitHub billing API and snapshotted for trend continuity
- **Infrastructure**: Azure Container Apps, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Container Registry, Key Vault

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for detailed architecture documentation.

The optional **AI Analyst** turns your Copilot data into written executive, cost, adoption, and
delivery analysis using the GitHub Copilot SDK. See
[docs/ai-analyst.md](docs/ai-analyst.md) for a full transparency report on the data it gathers, the
prompts it uses, and how analysis is generated, cached, and secured.

## ✅ Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 24+ and **pnpm** (`corepack enable`)
- **PostgreSQL** 18+ (local or cloud)
- **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** with Copilot enabled
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** with `manage_billing:copilot`, `read:enterprise`, `read:org` scopes

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ghcp-dashboard.git
cd ghcp-dashboard

# 2. Install dependencies
cd app
pnpm install

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database URL and admin password

# 4. Run database migrations
pnpm exec drizzle-kit migrate

# 5. Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and navigate to **Settings** to configure your GitHub token and sync schedule.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | PostgreSQL connection string (e.g. `postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db`) |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | No | Password for Settings page access. If unset, settings are open to all. Only leave this unset for local development on a trusted machine |
| `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` | No | Password gate for all dashboard pages. If unset, dashboards are open to all. Only leave this unset for local development or intentionally public dashboards |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_ID` | No | Git commit SHA shown in sidebar footer (auto-set in Docker) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TIME` | No | Build timestamp shown in sidebar footer (auto-set in Docker) |

> [!WARNING]
> For any non-local deployment, set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to protect the **Settings** page. The Settings UI can configure the GitHub token, Enterprise slug, and sync interval. If dashboard pages should not be publicly accessible, also set `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`. Leaving these unset is only recommended for local development on a trusted machine.
The **GitHub token**, **Enterprise slug**, and **sync interval** are configured via the Settings UI and stored in the database.

## 🚢 Deployment

**Azure is the recommended — and simplest — way to get the dashboard up and running.** A single `azd up` provisions every resource, wires up secrets and managed identity, and deploys the app. If you'd rather run it yourself, a self-hosted option is fully supported too.

### ⭐ Option 1 — Azure (recommended)

The fastest path to a production-ready deployment. This project ships Infrastructure as Code (Bicep) and an [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/) configuration, so one command stands everything up for you (Container Apps, PostgreSQL, Container Registry, Key Vault, and Application Insights).

**Requirements**

- An Azure subscription
- [Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (used to build the app image)

**Deploy**

```bash
# Provision infrastructure + deploy the app (first run)
azd up

# Subsequent deploys (app only)
azd deploy
```

When the deploy finishes, `azd` prints the app URL. Open it, go to **Settings**, and add your GitHub token and sync schedule — that's it.

#### 💵 Estimated monthly cost

A typical deployment in the **North Europe** region costs **approximately $45 / month** (USD), ranging from roughly **$35 to $65 / month** depending on dashboard traffic and log volume. Figures are pay-as-you-go list-price estimates; reserved capacity or savings plans reduce them further. For a precise quote, use the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).

### 🐳 Option 2 — Self-hosted (bring your own infrastructure)

Run the dashboard anywhere you can host a container — your own VM, Kubernetes, another cloud, or on-premises.

**Requirements**

- **PostgreSQL** 18+ (managed or self-run), reachable from the app
- **Docker** — the app ships a production `Dockerfile` with Next.js standalone output (or use **Node.js** 24+ and **pnpm** for local development)
- **TLS / reverse proxy** (e.g. nginx, Caddy) in front of the app for any shared deployment
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** with `manage_billing:copilot`, `read:enterprise`, `read:org` (added later via the Settings UI)
- Environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)):
  - `DATABASE_URL` — **required**
  - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` — **required** for any shared/non-local deployment
  - `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` — optional, gates all dashboard pages
  - `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` — optional, enables telemetry

**Run with Docker**

```bash
# Build the production image
docker build -t copilot-insights ./app

# Run it against your PostgreSQL instance
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/copilot_insights?sslmode=require" \
  -e ADMIN_PASSWORD="<strong-password>" \
  copilot-insights
```

Database migrations run automatically on startup. Once the container is up, open `http://localhost:3000` (or your proxied URL), go to **Settings**, and configure your GitHub token and sync schedule.

> [!TIP]
> For local development, use the [Quick Start](#quick-start) above (`pnpm run dev`) instead of building a container.

## 🔄 Data Sync

The dashboard supports two sync modes:

1. **Auto-sync**: Background sync on a configurable interval (default: every 6 hours). Runs via `instrumentation.ts` on server startup.
2. **Manual sync**: Trigger from the Settings → Data Sync page via SSE streaming.

Both modes call the GitHub Copilot Usage Metrics API (v2026-03-10) and transform the data into a star schema for analytics queries.
