## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Package manager** — migrated from npm to pnpm; lockfile is now `app/pnpm-lock.yaml`, dependency overrides and build-script approvals live in `app/pnpm-workspace.yaml`, and the Docker build, CI workflows, and devcontainer use pnpm via Corepack

### Added

- **PR & Autofix dashboard** — new page at `/pull-requests` with AI-assisted PR creation, Copilot code review suggestions, autofix analytics, and merge metrics; includes 12 KPIs, 7 charts (PR Activity, Copilot Impact, TTM, Copilot vs Standard donut, Copilot Review Activity, Suggestions Over Time, Suggestion Outcome), and org breakdown table with autofix columns
